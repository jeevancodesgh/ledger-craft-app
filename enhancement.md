3. **Global Search**: Implement search across invoices, customers, and items
4. **Bulk Operations**: Enable bulk actions for invoice management
5. **Enhanced Empty States**: Improve guidance for new users

### **Medium Priority (User Experience)**
1. **Form Wizard Approach**: Break complex forms into steps
2. **Dashboard Customization**: Allow users to configure their dashboard
3. **Mobile Gestures**: Add swipe actions for mobile users
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering for better data management
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add power user shortcuts

### **Low Priority (Advanced Features)**
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user invoice editing
2. **Camera Integration**: Document scanning capabilities
3. **Push Notifications**: Payment reminders and updates
4. **Offline Functionality**: Complete offline support
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive insights and forecasting

## Technical Considerations

- **Maintain Mobile-First Approach**: Continue prioritizing mobile experience
- **Preserve Performance**: Ensure enhancements don't impact loading times
- **Consistent Design System**: Use existing shadcn/ui components for consistency
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement features that work across all devices
- **Data Security**: Maintain current security practices with new features

## Detailed Analysis

### Invoice Management Flow Analysis

**Create Invoice Flow** (`src/pages/CreateInvoice.tsx`):
- Auto-generates invoice numbers using `invoiceService.getNextInvoiceNumber()`
- Pre-fills defaults from business profile (notes, terms, currency)
- Sets default due date to 30 days from creation
- Integrates customer creation via inline drawer
- Handles newly added customers with auto-selection
- Saves as 'draft' status initially

**Edit Invoice Flow** (`src/pages/EditInvoice.tsx`):
- Fetches existing invoice data
- Handles loading states and error handling
- Updates document title for print support
- Reuses the same InvoiceForm component with different mode

### User Interface Patterns and Navigation

**InvoiceForm Component** (`src/components/invoice/InvoiceForm.tsx`):
- **Tabbed Interface**: Edit and Preview tabs with smooth transitions
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout with mobile-specific optimizations
- **Unsaved Changes Protection**: Uses React Router's `useBlocker` to prevent data loss
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Collapsible sections for better organization
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Mobile UX Strengths

#### Mobile Detection & Breakpoint Strategy
- **Clean Detection**: Uses a custom `useIsMobile` hook with 768px breakpoint
- **Responsive Hook**: Properly listens to window resize events and media queries
- **Consistent Usage**: Mobile detection is consistently applied across all major components

#### PWA Integration Quality
- **Comprehensive PWA Setup**: Complete manifest with proper icons, theme colors, and standalone display
- **Smart Installation Prompts**: Separate handling for iOS and Android installation patterns
- **Dismissible Prompts**: Users can permanently dismiss installation prompts
- **Rich Icon Set**: Extensive Apple splash screen support for various device sizes

### Identified UX Pain Points

1. **Template Selection Timing**: Templates are only selectable in preview mode, not during creation
2. **Mobile Line Item Editing**: Requires drawer interaction for each item, could be cumbersome for multiple items
3. **Preview Generation**: Must validate entire form before previewing, preventing quick template comparisons
4. **Customer Selection**: Dropdown only shows name without additional context (email, recent invoices)
5. **Invoice Number Management**: Auto-generation might conflict with user preferences for custom numbering
6. **Form Complexity**: Large single-page form with many fields could be overwhelming
7. **Unsaved Changes Dialog**: Generic browser dialog instead of custom styled modal
8. **Template Preview**: No visual preview of templates before selection
