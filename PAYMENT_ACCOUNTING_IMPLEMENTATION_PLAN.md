# Complete Payment & Accounting System Implementation Plan
## Test-Driven Development Approach with NZ IRD Compliance

### **Executive Summary**

This comprehensive plan transforms Ledger Craft from an invoice generation tool into a full-featured accounting system with payment processing, automatic tax calculations, receipt generation, and New Zealand IRD compliance features. The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and excludes payment gateway integration initially, focusing on robust accounting foundations.
