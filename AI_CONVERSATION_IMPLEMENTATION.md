## Usage Examples

### Creating an Invoice
```
User: "Create an invoice for John Smith for web design services, $500"
AI: "I'll create an invoice for John Smith. Let me check if we have this customer... Found John Smith in your customer list. I'll create an invoice for web design services - $500. Should I proceed?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "Perfect! I've created invoice #INV-2024-001 for John Smith: Web design services - $500, Due date: January 31, 2024. Would you like me to send this invoice via email?"
```

### Finding Customer Information
```
User: "Do we have a customer named Sarah?"
AI: "I found Sarah Johnson in your customers. She's a VIP customer with 3 paid invoices totaling $2,450. Her last invoice was paid on December 15th. Would you like to see her full details or create a new invoice for her?"
```

### Generating Reports
```
User: "How's my business doing this month?"
AI: "Here's your December performance summary:
ðŸ“Š Revenue: $12,450 (â†‘15% from November)  
ðŸ’° Expenses: $3,200 (â†“8% from November)
ðŸŽ¯ Profit Margin: 74.3%
ðŸ“ˆ Top customers: John Smith ($2,100), Sarah Johnson ($1,850)

Your business is showing strong growth! Would you like me to show you a detailed breakdown or create a visual report?"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Database Migration

Run the migration to set up conversation tables:
```bash
supabase db push
```

### OpenAI Model Configuration

The implementation uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default. You can modify the model in `src/services/aiService.ts`:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/chat/completions`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // or 'gpt-4' for better accuracy
    messages,
    max_tokens: 500,
    temperature: 0.3,
  }),
});
```

## Security

### Authentication
- All conversations are tied to authenticated users
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect user data
- Conversation access is restricted to owners

### Data Privacy
- Conversations are stored securely in Supabase
- AI processing uses OpenAI API with standard privacy policies
- Sensitive business data is encrypted in transit

### Action Confirmation
- High-risk actions require user confirmation
- Risk levels: low, medium, high
- Detailed parameter display before execution

## Performance

### Optimization
- Conversation context is cached and updated incrementally
- Recent entities are stored for fast lookup
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI API calls are managed to prevent abuse
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Retry logic for failed requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OpenAI API Key Not Configured**
```
Error: OpenAI API key not configured
Solution: Add VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY to your .env.local file
```

**Database Migration Failed**
```
Error: Failed to create conversation tables
Solution: Run `supabase db push` to apply migrations
```

**Intent Classification Low Confidence**
```
Issue: AI doesn't understand user requests
Solution: Add more training examples or improve prompts in aiService.ts
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your environment:
```
VITE_DEBUG_AI=true
```

This will log AI responses and action executions to the console.
