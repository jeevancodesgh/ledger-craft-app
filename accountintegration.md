ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN account_class VARCHAR(20); -- Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, Expense
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN parent_account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id);
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN normal_balance VARCHAR(10); -- 'debit' or 'credit'

-- Create account templates table
CREATE TABLE account_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  account_number VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  account_class VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  account_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
